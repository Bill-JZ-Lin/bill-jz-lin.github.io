description: Hello! I'm a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of California, Davis, with a research focus on human-machine interaction, biochemical sensing, and machine learning (ML) applications. Previously, I worked as a System-on-Chip Hardware Design Engineer at MediaTek, responsible for optimizing power consumption for flagship Dimensity series projects. My experience spans industry and academia, including research on self-driving vehicle power management at MIT Media Lab and circuit design contributions to Google Pixel devices during an internship at HTC. With a strong background in embedded systems, firmware design, and power management, I have received multiple awards in international competitions and have held a publication at the IEEE-EMBS Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Science.
